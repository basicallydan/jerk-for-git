# Jerk for Git

In Britain, 'git' means something insulting, which always makes explaining the technology to people for the first time a tedious experience.

So, this is a set of aliases which make use of insulting American slang.

## How to use

* `jerk` = `git`
* `it` = `pull`
* `off` = `commit`
* `bank` = `stash`
* `to` = `push`
* `with` = `merge`
* 
All other commands are the same for now.

## Example

To commit to the branch `mother` under the `your` remote:

`jerk off -m "Edited README.md"`
`jerk to your mother`

## Install

For **Windows**, please run "windows.bat" to get it all working.
**Linux & Mac** coming soon.
